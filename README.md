# ID Assignment 1: KIX

A fully fictional-based shoe retail store. KIX is a newly set-up shoe retailer company without many stores across Singapore. Our website will contain everything about our company as well as our shoes available, which can be shopped online. This will ultimately lead to our company name being more popular and more well-recognized, which we can use ads to further enhance the gains.

Moreover, with Covid-19 being a issue, many people, including myself, would not want to leave our homes. Our website would allow customers to shop online as well as getting more people to know about our company, which will greatly increase the company's sales. With this website, it will also increase our company's credibility as we will gain online presence.

## Design Process

This website is for shoe collectors and people who are looking to buy trending, popular shoes who want to order them online as well as for people who want to know more about our company. Our website would provide details about our brand such as the stores available, terms of use, privacy policy, etc. Details of our shoes will also be showcased such as the sizes available and how the shoe looks. All this provided will definitely achieve what the user needs.

- As a user, I want to see the products KIX sells, I can click on the products page and see the prodcuts cards on how the shoe looks and what sizes it available, I can then click "Buy Now" button to add to my wishlist/cart.

  - About Us section: Starting from medium screen sizes (tablets), the information is arranged in a column direction, vertically and as screen size gets smaller, text gets smaller
  - Footer: Starting from medium screen sizes (tablets), information is displayed in a column direction vertically and text gets smaller when screen size decreases.
  - Products page: As screen size decreases, font size and weight decreases. Width and height of shoe cards also decreases. And as it in display wrap, amount of shoe cards in one row decreases from 3 to 2 to 1 bases on screen size.
